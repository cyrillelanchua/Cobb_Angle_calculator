# Cobb_Angle_calculator
Automatic cobb angle detection using the YOLO neural network. User would upload a picture of a Scoliosis X-ray and the device would automatically calculate the Cobb Angle of the Scoliosis.
This was my thesis in college so code can be a bit messy. Code, GUI, and cobb angle calculation needs improvement.
Notify me if you plan to use this program or want an exe file version.


GUI was created using PyQt.
This version uses the YOLOv3 coded in python3.7 with opencv 3.4.3.



The YOLOv3 weights can be downloaded here:

After downloading the weights, put it together with the .py files then run the Main.py.
